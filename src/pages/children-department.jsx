            <h4>
              Genesis 42:2 - Even a prophet can die without food,
              how much more our precious gifts from God. The word 
              equals spiritual food.
            </h4>
            <p>
              For this seasonal God’s assignment, in partnership with the
               Holy Spirit, Jesus the mediator of this new covenant, 
               alignment with RCCG, and submission to the leadership of JCA,
              we hope together, to equip our children as purposed 
              in God’s heart for this end time revival of Zion (Joel 2: 28).
            </p>
            <p>
              ​Word as given - In responding to the burden of our leader which
               we believe is also the heart of God for the children in this 
               season, having sought God to have our appropriate conviction 
               on expectations - discovering that amidst our children lies 
               apostles, prophets, entrepreneurs, teachers, and much more. 
               The heart of the Father is
               for their destinies to be called out with adequate root in Him.

                <li><span>They are built for spiritual strength</span> - Psalms 8:2 "Out of the mouth of babes", God ordained strength to still the enemy - The reason why David could handle Goliath, Jeremiah could speak to evildoers</li>
                <li><span>God’s heart is for children to experience Him early</span> to grow into experiencing His glory - Psalms 63:1 "Early will I seek thee"; to see your glory as I have seen thee in the tabernacle</li>

              <p>
                <ul>
                  <li><span>We bridge spiritual gaps/access</span>. Matthew 12:44 - The enemy targets empty 
                    houses. Proverbs 16: 27-29 - An idle hand is the devil’s workshop
                  </li>
                  <li><span>We secure the spiritual mantles of families/territories</span>. Matthew 7:9 -
                    It is our responsibility to give them bread and not stones
                  </li>
                  <li><span>Social education is healthy but limited</span>   - It cannot defeat the enemy. John 3:10 
                    - Jesus expressed to Nicodemus that there is a superior knowledge earthly 
                    teachers cannot give. Romans 15: 4 - "All scriptures are written for learning", 
                    - Paul commended us all to be built up by God’s word, 2 Corinthians 10:4 – 
                    "the weapons of our warfare are not carnal"
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span>We are in the last days - outpouring of the Spirit is for the 
                    children</span> also. Joel 2: 28 - our sons and daughters inclusive
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span>Not training them spiritually is equal to EATING OUR CHILDREN</span>. 2 Kings 6:24-33. 
                    Spiritual famine/laxity of parents is like us eating our children
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span>So, they can become aware, their body is a house of prayer</span>, not den of robbers
                    (Matthew 21:13).  1 Corinthians 6:19-20 - Their bodies are temples
                  </li>
                  <li><span>We cannot keep going and leave our children in Egypt or inside the destructive flood</span> . Proverbs 14: 12 - There is a way that seemeth right. Genesis 7:7 
                    - Noah and his children were in the ark. 1 Samuel 3:3- Samuel slept close to the ark. Exodus 10:24-28. If Pharoah could negotiate cattle and flocks, he can
                    negotiate children as well, like He did with ELI the prophet. BUT WE SAY OUR CHILDREN WOULD GO WITH US!
                  </li>
                  <li><span>They are the saviours of tomorrow including our families</span> . Samuel and Jesus alike, 
                    grew to become SAVIOURS of their purposed time 1 Samuel 3:19, Luke 2:52
                  </li>
                  <li><span>They may start knowing our God BUT they must grow knowing He is also their GOD- CONVICTION</span> . 2 
                    Timothy 1:12-I know whom I believe, and I am persuaded that he can guard what we entrust in His hands till the end
